### BUILDING INTERACTIVE WEBSITES

# Rock, Paper, or Scissors

#### Objective provided by Codecademy:

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

* Rock destroys scissors.
* Scissors cut paper.
* Paper covers rock.
* If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

Our code will break the game into four parts:

1) Get the user’s choice.
2) Get the computer’s choice.
3) Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
4) Start the program and display the results.
